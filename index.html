    <h3>Unfinished ending</h3>
    John was fed up with his neighbours. They were blacksmiths and while they worked they made a lot of noise.John could not work, sleep or relax. What was he to do?
John was a well-to-do money-lender. He had a big house and a lot of servants.
But he had one big problem. He had two very noisy neighbours.
Harry and Sharry were both blacksmiths and made a lot of noise while they worked. Thakkthakk! Bang bang! Boom boom! It went on all day long. And quite often late into the night, John found it difficult to sleep. And sometimes he could hardly hear himself speak during the day! But it was no use speaking to them or asking them to make less noise. 
“I’m not rich like you,” said Harry, “and my tools are old and creaky. I can’t help making noise when I work.”
 “But there’s a lot of shouting as well,” complained John.
“I can’t help it if my customers speak loudly,” said Harry, “I can’t ask them to keep their voices low when they have a problem.”
“Why don’t you try stuffing cotton into your ears?” suggested Sharry, “then you won’t be able to hear us.”
 John tried different tactics. “Let me buy your houses,” he said, “I’ll pay you a good price.”
“No way,” said Harry, “I know what you mean by a good price! I know all the mean old tricks you employ when you lend people money. I’m not falling into your trap.”

“We’ll simply end up losing both house and money because you’ll find some excuse not to pay us,” said Sharry, “besides, it’s our ancestral house so there’s no question of selling it”.
A plan
 Finally in sheer desperation John went to them again.
“Keep your houses,” he said, “I’ll make you a handsome payment if only you shift to a different house for the next five years.”
“You are sure you won’t ask for anything more?” asked Harry.
“Nothing except that you shift elsewhere,” said John.
“That could be done,” said Harry looking at Sharry.
“We’ll shift to a different house for five years,” said Sharry, “But not unless you pay us the money first.”
John paid them the money grudgingly. After all he was a shrewd man and knew that this was a total loss. But at least he’d be able to live and sleep in peace now. He saw Harry and Sharry packing their things and was happy. He was even happier when he saw them leaving with their luggage. “I’ll have a peaceful time at last,” he said to himself.
But when he went to bed that night he heard the same old noises once again. He could not imagine what was wrong! Had he not seen them leave with their luggage that very morning with his own eyes?
